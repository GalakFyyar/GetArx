1. Make sure you have these files/folders in one folder:
jPortable
baseball.bat
GetArx.exe

2. Place Chapter Reading Assignment jar in that folder. You'll find them in the chs folder

3. Run GetArx.exe this will generate a text file (Ans.txt) I'd suggest viewing this in
a program that lists the line numbers, such as NotePad++ so you can follow along with
the Chapter Reading Assignment jar

4. Profit.
